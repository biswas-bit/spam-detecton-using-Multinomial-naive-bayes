# 📧 Spam Detection using Naive Bayes

This project is a **Machine Learning-based Spam Detection System** that classifies SMS or text messages as **Spam** or **Ham** (Not Spam).  
It uses **Naive Bayes algorithms** (Gaussian, Multinomial, and Bernoulli) to compare performance and find the best-performing model.

## 🚀 Features
- ✅ Preprocessing pipeline: text cleaning, tokenization, stemming, and stopword removal  
- ✅ Vectorization using **CountVectorizer**  
- ✅ Trains three Naive Bayes models:
  - Gaussian Naive Bayes
  - Multinomial Naive Bayes
  - Bernoulli Naive Bayes
- ✅ Model comparison based on accuracy and confusion matrix
- ✅ Easy testing with custom messages (ham/spam)
